# Automated-Berkeley-Course-Search
There are A LOT of non-major requirements at UC Berkeley (7 breadth/general education, 4 college, and 3 UC) and even more classes (roughly 5500) to fulfill them. Although I love indulging in interdisciplinary classes and topics to embrace various perspectives and thus broaden and strengthen the applications of my work, due to the extremely competitive landscape of Berkeley's course selection, I needed to optimize my schedule by fulfilling as many requirements as I could with minimal classes. So, I created a Python script using the Selenium package to automate finding and sorting classes that satisfy 2+ requirements. The code navigates through and interacts with Berkeley's Academic Guide Class Schedule html webpage, clicking and unclicking through all the requirement filter buttons, expanding hidden filter sections, and paginating through every search result to collect all possible classes. It then compiles the data into a dictionary. Finally, I extract the classes that satisfy at least 1 breadth and 1 general requirement and save them to a csv file for easy viewing and comparing. This tool helps me—and could potentially help other students—strategically plan schedules without manually cross-referencing thousands of classes and dozens of overlapping requirement charts.
