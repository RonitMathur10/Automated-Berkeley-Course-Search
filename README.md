# Automated-Berkeley-Course-Search
There are A LOT of non-major requirements (7 breadth/general education, 4 college, and 3 UC) at UC Berkeley and even more classes to take in order to fulfill them. In order to optimize my schedule by fulfilling as many requirements as I could with minimal classes, I created a Python script using the Selenium package to automate finding classes that satisfy 2+ requirements.
